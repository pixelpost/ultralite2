	The Auth plugin is a piece of Pixelpost base installation, it provides
	security methods and controls. This part of pixelpost
	handles all account permissions, connection to the API or the web admin.
	<br>
	This plugin is managed by the Pixelpost community.

	<strong>
		You can't uninstall or delete this plugin.
	</strong>
	<br>
	You can inactive this plugin, however this seems to be a bad idea, your
	pixelpost installation will be unsecure at all. So anyone can access to the
	admin interface, change settings, etcâ€¦
